Hi👋, my name is Tobias Hefele,

I am a freelancing software developer and architect. Additionally I am a certified Usability and UX Expert.
I am interested in collaborating on innovative and/or complex projects. 
I'm a very curious person and have many years of experience in software development of projects of all scales.

Due to all that I can help my clients in all phases of projects; I can provide support during user analysis, concept, implementation and rollout and (usability) testing.
I help my clients 
- ✅ with expert know-how in software development,
- ✅ by supporting in everything concering usability and user experience as a certified expert,
- ✅ by simultaneously focussing on feasibility and user needs,
- ✅ curiousity and fast familiarization even in complex topics.


For more information please refer to my 🌐[website](https://ease-it.online). 

You can reach me best by 📫[mail](mailto:info@ease-it.online).

Cheers,

Tobias
